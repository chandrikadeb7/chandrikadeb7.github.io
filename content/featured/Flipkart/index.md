Developed and implemented a machine learning model for classifying breast ultrasound images using the BreastMNIST dataset. Improved baseline performance by optimizing a ResNet-18 architecture, achieving AUC ≥ 0.901 and accuracy ≥ 0.863. The project included hyperparameter tuning, metric computation (AUPR, precision, recall, F1 score), 5-fold cross-validation, and result visualization through ROC and PR curves. Presented findings through a detailed poster, showcasing technical insights and comparative analysis.
